## Overview

RhondaLibraryPOC is a Proof of Concept (POC) project for a library management system. It provides functionality for managing books, users, and checkout processes. The system includes features such as overdue calculations and fine accruals. This Project uses principles from Clean Architecture.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- .NET SDK
- PostgreSQL (or another compatible database)

## Libraries Used

- **[MediatR](link_to_library_1):** The main goal is to design reusable components with “loose coupling.”.
- **[Dapper](link_to_library_2):** Dapper is an object–relational mapping product for the Microsoft .NET platform: it provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.
- **[ErrorOR](link_to_library_2):** A simple, fluent discriminated union of an error or a result. Allowing for creating customer extensions to handle various errors or result
- **[Moq](link_to_library_2):** A simple mocking library that helps create a concrete implementation of an interface and control how certain methods on that interface respond when called
